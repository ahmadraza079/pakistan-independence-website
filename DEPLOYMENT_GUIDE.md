# 🚀 GitHub Deployment Guide

This guide will help you upload your Pakistan Independence Day website to GitHub and deploy it for free.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free at [github.com](https://github.com))
- Git installed on your computer ([download here](https://git-scm.com/))

## 📁 Upload to GitHub

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the green "New" button
   - Repository name: `pakistan-independence-website`
   - Description: `🇵🇰 A patriotic website celebrating Pakistan's Independence Day`
   - Make it Public (so you can use GitHub Pages for free)
   - **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload your project files:**
   - On the repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop ALL your project files:
     - All files from your main directory (client/, server/, version2/, etc.)
     - Include README.md, package.json, and other config files
     - The attached_assets/ folder with your Pakistani destination images
   - Write commit message: "Initial commit: Pakistan Independence Day website"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Option 2: Using Git Command Line

If you prefer using the command line:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Pakistan Independence Day website"

# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pakistan-independence-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
